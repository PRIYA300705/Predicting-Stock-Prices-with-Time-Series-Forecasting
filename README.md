# Predicting Stock Prices with Time Series Forecasting



## About the Project
This project focuses on building and comparing stock price prediction models using historical market data. It involves loading and preprocessing data with yfinance and Pandas, followed by implementing ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet models to forecast stock price trends. Model performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics. The analysis aims to identify the most effective model accurate stock price predictions, providing insights for financial forecasting applications.

## How to Access the Project
1. Ensure Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab is installed (via Anaconda or `pip install notebook`).
2. Install required libraries: `pip install yfinance pandas numpy statsmodels tensorflow prophet scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Clone or download the project folder from GitHub.
4. Navigate to the folder in your terminal or command prompt.
5. Run `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter server.
6. Open `StockPrice_Forecast.ipynb` in the browser interface.
Alternatively, upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Colab (colab.research.google.com) for online execution. Ensure `NFLX.csv` is in the same directory or uploaded to Colab to load the data correctly.
